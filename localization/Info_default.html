##BAsket|
<h1>Help on "Home"</h1>
<p>The BAsket is the software complex for a Trading Agent who wants generate
Orders for Clients using mobile devices (smartphones and tablets)
i.e. to do it quickly, efficiently and with modern technology.</p>

<p>The complex is divided into the Mobile Application (i.e. the BAsket, which you see now) and the Server 
Module. The Server Module is responsible for the data transmission and storage, as well as 
"interaction" with the ERP system of the company. The Server Module can be configured to your 
company's ERP system with plug-ins.
</p>
<p>The BAsket can operate in two basic Modes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Offline - data from the server when reading the <a href="#Info/ReadNews">News</a> is stored 
into the database (Web Db) of the device. Basically the program works exactly with the local data;</li>
    <li>Direct Access - all requests are sent directly to the server, and the server's response 
is displayed directly on your screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two Modes have a lot of advantages and disadvantages, and we give here only a part of them.</p>
<p>The Offline Mode:</p>
<ul>
    <li>does not require permanent access to Internet;</li>
    <li>Internet traffic is very low;</li>
    <li>system response entirely depends on the speed of your mobile device.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The main advantage of the Direct Access is permanently relevant data. 
The Stocks-in-Trade as well as the Lists of Goods and Clients on your screen are always as close 
as possible to your ERP system.</p>

<p>There are additional technical limitations of using the Offline Mode. Devices which use such Internet 
browsers as Google Chrome (Android), Opera or Safari (iOs), will be able to use the Offline Mode, others 
will have to be content with the advantages of the Direct Access.</p>
<p>The Program can be used on an ordinary computer, but in this case, the Offline Mode is available 
only with Google Chrome.</p>

<p>The BAsket is the cross-platform and cross-browser application that is written with
Single-Page Application modern technology. Such technologies as HTML5, CSS3,
JS-frameworks PhoneJS, JQuery, Knockout are used here. In fact - the BAsket is the website that can also work
as a native application for mobile devices, thanks to PhoneGap technology.</p>
<p>It is natural that this application works slower then native application on a mobile device. 
But, first, device productivity is growing very fast, and secondly, the ability to work with
one software on different types of devices promises great benefits from using.</p>
<p>Although the program is announced to support communicators, we still advise using tablets for real 
work, because screen size is very importan here.</p>

<p>The BAsket contains the following functionality:</p>
<ul>    
    <li>Preparation and correction of the Client <a href="#Info/Order">Orders</a>;</li>
    <li>Working with the <a href="#Info/OrderList">List of Orders</a>;</li>
    <li>The List of <a href="#Info/RoadMapList">Road Maps</a>, which determines the Route of a Trading 
Agent;</li>
    <li>The <a href="#Info/Clients">List of Clients</a>, where you can see the Route from the current 
location to a particular Trading Point;</li>
    <li>The <a href="#Info/ReadNews">News</a> Screen, where information is exchanged with the server;</li>
    <li>The System <a href="#Info/Preferences">Configuration</a>, where among others you can "play" 
with the interface styles of various types of mobile devices.</li>
</ul>
